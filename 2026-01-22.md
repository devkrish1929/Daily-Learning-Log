## Subject
SSAD (Structured System Analysis and Design)

## Topics Covered
- System modularisation
- Breaking a large system into smaller modules
- Introduction to AI techniques in system design

## Key Learnings
- A system should be divided into independent modules for better maintainability
- Modules reduce complexity and improve understanding
- SSAD focuses on structure, logic, and clear documentation
- AI techniques can help in decision-making and optimisation during system design

## Observations
- Modular design makes large systems easier to manage
- Proper analysis is more important than jumping directly into coding

## Next Step
- Revise SSAD diagrams and module design techniques
