# Daily Learning Log

This repository contains short, daily notes of what I learn while studying computer science.
Updates are kept minimal, honest, and consistent.

## Purpose
- Track daily learning
- Build a habit of reflection
- Maintain a transparent GitHub activity log

## Format
Each entry follows this structure:
- Date
- Topic
- 3–5 key points
- Doubts or next steps
